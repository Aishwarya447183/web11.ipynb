    "An example of an API being used in real life is the Google Maps API. This API allows developers to integrate Google Maps into their own applications. For example, if you use a ridesharing app like Uber or Lyft, the map that shows you where your driver is and where you're going is powered by the Google Maps API. The app developers do not have to build their own mapping software from scratch; instead, they can use the API to access Google's mapping functionality and integrate it into their app."

    "REST (Representational State Transfer) and SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) are two popular architectural styles used in web services.\n",
    "\n",
    "REST architecture is a style that uses HTTP protocols to transfer data and build web services. REST uses standard HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to create, read, update, and delete data. It is a lightweight architecture and is easier to implement than SOAP. REST is widely used for building APIs for mobile and web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP architecture, on the other hand, is a messaging protocol used for exchanging structured data between applications. SOAP uses XML for communication and provides additional features such as security and reliability. It is a more robust architecture and is often used for enterprise-level applications where security and reliability are critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortcomings of SOAP:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: SOAP is a complex architecture, and its implementation can be time-consuming and costly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overhead: SOAP adds a significant amount of overhead to messages due to its use of XML, which can result in slower performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security: Although SOAP provides security features, it can be vulnerable to attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited flexibility: SOAP has a rigid structure and is less flexible than REST. This can make it challenging to integrate with other systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Versioning: SOAP can be difficult to version, as changes to the interface can cause compatibility issues with existing clients.\n",

    "Security: SOAP provides advanced security features such as WS-Security, while REST relies on HTTPS for security.\n",
    "\n",
    "Caching: REST supports caching of responses, which can improve performance. SOAP does not support caching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: REST is a more scalable architecture because it uses lightweight messages and stateless communication. SOAP is less scalable due to its heavy messages and stateful communication.\n",
